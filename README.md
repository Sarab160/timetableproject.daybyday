# ðŸ“… Day 03 â€“ Basic Desktop Application of TimelyAI
## âœ… Features Implemented
Developed a simple desktop application prototype of TimelyAI using sample data.

Implemented user interface features to:

Select Classes â€“ Users can choose the classes for which the timetable is to be generated.

Assign Teachers to Subjects â€“ Each subject can be assigned a teacher.

Set Lecture Start Time â€“ Users can define when the first lecture of the day begins.

Set Period Duration â€“ Users can set how long each lecture period should be (e.g., 45 minutes, 60 minutes).

Added functionality to generate a timetable based on user selections.

## ðŸ§ª Special Handling
Theory and Lab Classes are handled differently:

Theory: Standard duration based on selected period length.

Lab: Scheduled for three times the duration of a theory period and grouped as a block.

## ðŸ›  Current Scope
Uses basic/mock data.

Timetable generation works for selected classes with initial logic.

UI is functional but designed for basic testing and development.
