# ðŸ“… Day 04 â€“ Timetable PDF Export Feature Added
## âœ… Whatâ€™s New
PDF export functionality has been implemented for the timetable.

Time slots for each period are now clearly shown in the PDF.

A heading labeled "Free Lecture" is added wherever a period is empty.

All slots are neatly and clearly formatted for professional readability.

This update helps generate a complete, printable version of the timetable that includes both scheduled lectures and clearly marked free periods with accurate time ranges
